# Contributing to MCP-Sim

We welcome contributions to the MCP-Sim platform, whether it's new models, improvements to the core SDK, documentation updates, or bug fixes!

## Ways to Contribute

1.  **Develop New Model Nodes:** Create and share new scientific micro-models.
2.  **Improve Existing Models:** Enhance accuracy, performance, or add new capabilities.
3.  **Enhance the SDK/Router:** Contribute to the core platform components.
4.  **Write Documentation:** Help us improve guides, tutorials, and API references.
5.  **Suggest Features:** Propose new ideas to make MCP-Sim better.
6.  **Report Bugs:** Identify and report issues with clear, reproducible steps.

## Development Workflow (Code Contributions)

1.  **Fork the Repository:**
    Start by forking the relevant MCP-Sim repository (e.g., `mcp-sim/mcp-node-sdk`, `mcp-sim/router`, or the public starter kit [`mcp-sim-starter-kit`](https://github.com/mcp-sim/mcp-sim-starter-kit)) to your GitHub account.

2.  **Clone Your Fork:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

3.  **Create a Branch:**
    Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name (e.g., `feat/soil-carbon-model`, `fix/hydro/correct-runoff-coeff`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feat/soil-carbon-model
    ```

4.  **Make Your Changes:**
    Implement your feature, bug fix, or improvement.
    *   Follow the coding style guide (see below).
    *   Write unit tests for new functionality.
    *   Run **`pytest -q`** and ensure all tests pass.

5.  **Run Pre-commit Hooks:**
    If the project uses pre-commit hooks, ensure they pass:
    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit==3.6.0
    pre-commit install
    pre-commit run --all-files
    ```
    Commit any changes made by the hooks.

6.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    Use clear and concise commit messages, following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "fix(hydro): correct runoff coeff"
    ```

7.  **Push to Your Fork:**
    ```bash
    git push origin feat/soil-carbon-model
    ```

8.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    Go to the original MCP-Sim repository on GitHub and open a Pull Request from your branch to the `main` (or `develop`) branch of the upstream repository.
    *   Provide a clear description of your changes in the PR.
    *   Link to any relevant issues.

## CI & Pre-commit Checks

All PRs must pass Continuous Integration (CI) checks, which typically include:
*   Running `pytest` for all unit tests.
*   Linting (e.g., Flake8).
*   Code formatting (e.g., Black, isort).
*   `jsonschema` validation (`metadata.json`).

Ensure your code passes all local pre-commit hooks and tests before pushing.

## Coding Style

*   **Python:** Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting.
*   **Docstrings:** Use [Google Python Style Docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#3.8-comments-and-docstrings). For Pydantic models, field docstrings will appear in auto-generated schemas.
*   **Commit Messages:** Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) if possible.  
    Example: `fix(hydro): correct runoff coeff`

## Licensing

*   Contributions to the core MCP-Sim platform (SDK, Router) are typically under the Apache-2.0 License.
*   New model nodes contributed to the community marketplace can be licensed under **MIT or Apache-2.0 only**. Please include a `LICENSE` file in your model repository.
*   If you add third-party code, ensure licence compatibility.

## Model Node Bounty Program

ðŸŽ‰ **Earn 1,000 MCP-Sim credits!** ðŸŽ‰

For each new, unique, and well-documented scientific model node that is accepted into the official MCP-Sim community marketplace (or a designated community repository), the primary contributor(s) will receive a bounty of 1,000 MCP-Sim platform credits.

**Criteria for Bounty:**
*   Model must be scientifically valid and provide a useful capability.
*   Must include comprehensive `metadata.json` as per schema.
*   Must include working unit tests (`pytest`).
*   Must be containerized with a `Dockerfile`.
*   Must have clear documentation (README, docstrings).
*   Must be licensed under MIT or Apache-2.0.
*   Must be approved and merged by the MCP-Sim maintainers.
*   One bounty per unique capability; duplicates may not qualify.
