# Router API Reference

The MCP Router acts as the central hub for discovering, validating, and executing models. It exposes two sets of APIs: one for model nodes to register and communicate, and another for client applications to interact with the platform.

_See [Docker Deployment](../06-docker-deploy) for container environment variable examples._

## Node-Facing Endpoints (for Model Nodes)

These endpoints are used by individual MCP Model Nodes to interact with the Router.

### `POST /mcp/register`

Used by a model node to register itself with the router. The router will periodically check the node's health.

**Request Body:** (abridged example)
```json
{
  "model_id": "hydro_runoff_v1",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "Hydrology Runoff Model",
  "node_url": "http://my-hydro-model:5000",
  "endpoints": {
    "execute": "/mcp/execute",
    "health": "/health"
  },
  "capabilities": ["simulate_runoff"]
}
```

**Response:**
*   `200 OK`: Registration successful.
*   `400 Bad Request`: Invalid metadata or missing `node_url`.
*   `409 Conflict`: Node with same `model_id` and `node_url` already registered.

### `POST /mcp/unregister`

Used by a model node to gracefully unregister itself from the router (e.g., during shutdown).

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "node_url": "http://my-hydro-model.example.com:5000"
}
```
**Response:**
*   `200 OK`: Unregistration successful.

### `GET /mcp/health` (Implemented by Model Nodes, Called by Router)

The router periodically calls this endpoint on registered model nodes to check their status. Model nodes must implement this.

**Expected Response from Node:**
```json
{ "status": "ok" }
// or
{ "status": "degraded", "details": "..." }
```
_Router hits this endpoint every 30 seconds by default (configurable via `HEALTH_POLL_SEC`)._

## Client-Facing Endpoints (for Client Applications)

These endpoints are used by client applications, scripts, dashboards, or other services to interact with the MCP-Sim platform.

### `GET /api/models`

Retrieves a list of all registered and healthy models, including their full metadata.

**Query Parameters (Optional):**
*   `tag=<string>`: Filter models by a specific tag.
*   `capability=<string>`: Filter models that have a specific capability.

**Response:** `200 OK`
```json
[
  { /* metadata of model 1 */ },
  { /* metadata of model 2 */ }
]
```

### `GET /api/models/{model_id}`

Retrieves the full metadata for a specific model ID.

**Query Parameters (Optional):**
*   `verbose=true`: Include transient health metrics (if supported).

**Response:** `200 OK`
```json
{ /* metadata of the requested model */ }
```
*   `404 Not Found`: If the model ID does not exist or is unhealthy.

### `POST /api/execute`

Executes a capability on a specific model. The router forwards the request to the appropriate model node.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "model_id": "hydro-runoff-v1", // Target model ID
  "capability": "simulate_runoff", // Target capability name
  "input_data": {
    "precip_mm": 20,
    "et_mm": 5
  },
  "request_id": "user-generated-uuid-123" // Optional: for client-side tracking; if omitted, router auto-generates a UUID.
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK` (if model execution is successful)  
The response body is the direct output from the model node's capability.
```json
{
  "runoff_mm": 9.0
}
```
**Error Responses:**
*   `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request format, missing fields.
*   `402 Payment Required`: User lacks credits (future).
*   `404 Not Found`: `model_id` or `capability` not found.
*   `409 Conflict`: Duplicate request ID.
*   `500 Internal Server Error`: Error during model execution on the node, or router internal error. The response body may contain error details from the node.
*   `503 Service Unavailable`: Model node is unhealthy or unreachable.

### `POST /api/simulate` (Advanced Composition — Future)

TBD — will accept DAG / JSON graph definition for orchestrating calls to multiple models.

> ░ This endpoint is a placeholder for future model composition capabilities. It might involve specifying a chain or graph of models to execute. ░

## Authentication & Authorization

> Today, endpoints are open. Planned: JWT-based authentication via header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.  
> Future: credit system integration for paid calls.
