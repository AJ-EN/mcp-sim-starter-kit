# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Here are some common questions about `MCP-Sim`.

## General

**What is MCP-Sim?**

`MCP-Sim` (Model Composition Platform - Simulation) is a system that turns scientific formulas, machine learning models, or empirical equations into composable microservices.  
It allows researchers and developers to easily deploy, discover, chain, and validate these "micro-models" via a standardized API.

**Who is MCP-Sim for?**

It's for scientists, engineers, researchers, and developers who work with mathematical models and want to:

* Make their models easily accessible as APIs.
* Discover and use models created by others.
* Compose complex simulations by chaining multiple models.
* Standardize model deployment and execution.

## Technical

**Do I need GPUs to run model nodes?**

No, not necessarily. The default model node setup using the Python SDK and Flask is CPU-based and suitable for many types of models.  
GPU support for computationally intensive models (e.g., deep learning) is planned for future SDK versions and custom node implementations.  
If your model requires PyTorch + CUDA, you can base your Dockerfile on `nvidia/cuda` and expose GPU resources via Docker's `--gpus` flag.

**How do credits work?**

- New users typically receive a starting balance of free credits (e.g., 100 credits) upon signup to the platform.  
- Each model node, in its `metadata.json`, can define a `cost_per_call` (in credits) for executing its capabilities.  
- If `cost_per_call` is omitted, it defaults to **0** (free).  
- The MCP Router manages the credit ledger, deducting credits from the user's account for each successful model execution.

**Can I run model nodes privately?**

Yes. If you run your own MCP Router instance, you can configure your model nodes to register only with your private router.  
Additionally, a model node can be run without registering with any router if you intend to call its API directly.  
Set the environment variable `MCP_REGISTER_ON_STARTUP=false` (or a similar mechanism in the SDK) to prevent a node from attempting to register with a public or default registry.

**What programming languages can I use to build a model node?**

While the primary SDK is currently for Python, the MCP (Model Control Protocol) is language-agnostic as it's based on JSON-RPC over HTTP.  
You can, in principle, implement an MCP-compliant model node in any language that can run an HTTP server and handle JSON.  
We plan to release SDKs for other popular languages in the future.

**How are models versioned?**

Models are versioned using semantic versioning (e.g., `1.0.0` for Major.Minor.Patch) specified in their `metadata.json`.  
The `model_id` should also ideally include the major version (e.g., `my-model-v1`) to distinguish between non-backward-compatible versions.  
See [Schema Spec](schema-spec) for versioning rules.

## Contributing & Community

**How can I contribute a model?**

Please see our [Contributing Guide](contributing) for details on how to develop, document, and submit your model node. We have a bounty program for accepted models!

**Where can I find existing models?**

The MCP-Sim platform will feature a community marketplace or model browser where you can discover and learn about registered models.  
_This feature is coming soon._

**Is there a community forum or Discord?**
